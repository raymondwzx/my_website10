<p>Ever since I was introduced to the world of impact investing, 1 I have been envisioning a future, in which the concept of “externalities” loses its relevance and social impact alongside risk and return becomes an integrated measure for all financial decisions.
In the long term, I would like to manage an early / growth stage investment fund that can support investees with innovative capital solutions and can provide a broader spectrum of investors with products suited for different risk-return-impact profiles. To achieve such a goal, I will begin my career in restructuring or leveraged finance advisory. By gaining exposure to more complex and unusual deals and below-investment-grade issuances, I hope to gain a solid grasp of quantitative and qualitative analysis skills, a better understanding of companies’ operations, and more insights on product and investment structure development.</p>
