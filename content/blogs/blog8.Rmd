title: My Leisure Life

In my leisure life, I love workout and traveling. 
Workout has become part of my daily life. Starting as a practical way to lose weight and get fit, it teaches me the incompatibility and balance between short-term satisfaction and long-term return, i.e., how to avoid the seduction from unhealthy lifestyle and focus on the long-term goal. Having tried many workout systems like Body Lifting, Power Lifting, and CrossFit, I just started my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training.
People like traveling in general and I do too. In recent years, I have more and more enjoyed solo traveling – not because I hate friends and family of course – because of the personal development I have gained in a series of solo traveling experiences. In these adventures, I got better at communication, problem-solving, flexible planning, and being more confident about situations out of my comfort zone. I also found myself much better at understanding others’ perspectives and easier to understand where the different opinions are coming from.
