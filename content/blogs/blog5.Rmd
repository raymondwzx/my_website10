Raymond Zexin Wu

The world needs changes, at a rate and scale never seen before, to resolve the myriad conflicts between classes, cultures, ideologies, genders and more. Fortunately, this is also an era of entrepreneurs who have devoted themselves to bringing transformational changes to the society and environment.

I believe in the power of entrepreneurship, and I am passionate about applying financial tools to support the development of companies and programs that will bring great social impacts.
